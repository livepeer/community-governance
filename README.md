# Community Governance

This repo contains information and tools for community governance of the Livepeer protocol.

## LIP Meetings

### Purpose

The LIP meeting is a bi-weekly discussion of [LIPs](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs) to improve the Livepeer protocol. The meeting will:

- Serve as a forum for synchronous, verbal feedback on LIPs to complement the asynchronous, written feedback that can be found in [LIP issues](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/issues), the [Livepeer forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/7wRSUGX).
- Enable LIP contributors to share updates on the status of a LIP's design and/or implementation. 
- Enable protocol developers to plan and coordinate the work necessary to implement and/or deploy a LIP.

### Who Can Attend

Anyone that is currently doing work related to a LIP or that is interested in providing feedback on a LIP is welcome to attend the meeting. 

### Agenda Items

The agenda for each meeting will be posted in an [issue](https://github.com/livepeer/pm/issues). Feedback on the agenda is welcome and anyone is welcome to suggest an addition to the agenda as long as the topic relates to an existing LIP or could be the subject of a LIP based on the LIP types described in [LIP-1](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-1.md).
